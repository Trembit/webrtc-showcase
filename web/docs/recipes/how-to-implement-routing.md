## How to Implement Routing and Navigation

Let's see how a custom routing solution under 100 lines of code may look like.

First, you will need to implement the **list of application routes** in which
each route can be represented as an object with properties of `path` (a
parametrized URL path string), `action` (a function), and optionally `children`
(a list of sub-routes, each of which is a route object). The `action` function
returns anything - a string, a React component, etc. For example:

#### `src/routes/index.js`

```js
export default [
  {
    path: '/tasks',
    action() {
      const resp = await fetch('/api/tasks');
      const data = await resp.json();
      return data && {
        title: `To-do (${data.length})`,
        component: <TodoList {...data} />
      };
    }
  },
  {
    path: '/tasks/:id',
    action({ params }) {
      const resp = await fetch(`/api/tasks/${params.id}`);
      const data = await resp.json();
      return data && {
        title: data.title,
        component: <TodoItem {...data} />
      };
    }
  }
];
```

Next, implement a **URL Matcher** function that will be responsible for matching
a parametrized path string to the actual URL. For example, calling
`matchURI('/tasks/:id', '/tasks/123')` must return `{ id: '123' }` while calling
`matchURI('/tasks/:id', '/foo')` must return `null`. Fortunately, there is a
great library called
[`path-to-regexp`](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) that makes this
task very easy. Here is how a URL matcher function may look like:

#### `src/router.js`

```js
import toRegExp from 'path-to-regexp';

function matchURI(path, uri) {
  const keys = [];
  const pattern = toRegExp(path, keys); // TODO: Use caching
  const match = pattern.exec(uri);
  if (!match) return null;
  const params = Object.create(null);
  for (let i = 1; i < match.length; i++) {
    params[keys[i - 1].name] = match[i] !== undefined ? match[i] : undefined;
  }
  return params;
}
```

Finally, implement a **Route Resolver** function that given a list of routes and
a URL/context should find the first route matching the provided URL string,
execute its action method, and if the action method returns anything other than
`null` or `undefined` return that to the caller. Otherwise, it should continue
iterating over the remaining routes. If none of the routes match to the provided
URL string, it should throw an exception (Not found). Here is how this function
may look like:

#### `src/router.js`

```js
import toRegExp from 'path-to-regexp';

function matchURI(path, uri) { ... } // See above

async function resolve(routes, context) {
  for (const route of routes) {
    const uri = context.error ? '/error' : context.pathname;
    const params = matchURI(route.path, uri);
    if (!params) continue;
    const result = await route.action({ ...context, params });
    if (result) return result;
  }
  const error = new Error('Not found');
  error.status = 404;
  throw error;
}

export default { resolve };
```

That's it! Here is a usage example:

```js
import router from './router';
import routes from './routes';

router.resolve(routes, { pathname: '/tasks' }).then(result => {
  console.log(result);
  // => { title: 'To-do', component: <TodoList .../> }
});
```

While you can use this as it is on the server, in a browser environment it must
be combined with a client-side navigation solution. You can use
[`history`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history) npm module to handles this
task for you. It is the same library used in React Router, sort of a wrapper
over [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/History_API)
that handles all the tricky browser compatibility issues related to client-side
navigation.

First, create `src/history.js` file that will initialize a new instance of the
`history` module and export is as a singleton:

#### `src/history.js`

```js
import createHistory from 'history/lib/createBrowserHistory';
import useQueries from 'history/lib/useQueries';
export default useQueries(createHistory)();
```

Then plug it in, in your client-side bootstrap code as follows:

#### `src/client.js`

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import history from './history';
import router from './router';
import routes from './routes';

const container = document.getElementById('root');

function renderRouteOutput({ title, component }) {
  ReactDOM.render(component, container, () => {
    document.title = title;
  });
}

function render(location) {
  router
    .resolve(routes, location)
    .then(renderRouteOutput)
    .catch(error =>
      router.resolve(routes, { ...location, error }).then(renderRouteOutput),
    );
}

render(history.getCurrentLocation()); // render the current URL
history.listen(render);
```

Whenever a new location is pushed into the `history` stack, the `render()`
method will be called, that itself calls the router's `resolve()` method and
renders the returned from it React component into the DOM.

In order to trigger client-side navigation without causing full-page refresh,
you need to use `history.push()` method, for example:

```js
import React from 'react';
import history from '../history';

class App extends React.Component {
  transition = event => {
    event.preventDefault();
    history.push({
      pathname: event.currentTarget.pathname,
      search: event.currentTarget.search,
    });
  };
  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/" onClick={this.transition}>
            Home
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/one" onClick={this.transition}>
            One
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/two" onClick={this.transition}>
            Two
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    );
  }
}
```

Though, it is a common practice to extract that transitioning functionality into
a stand-alone (`Link`) component that can be used as follows:

```html
<Link to="/tasks/123">View Task #123</Link>
```

### Routing in React Starter Kit

React Starter Kit (RSK) uses
[Universal Router](https://github.com/kriasoft/universal-router) npm module that
is built around the same concepts demonstrated earlier with the major
differences that it supports nested routes and provides you with the helper
`Link` React component. It can be seen as a lightweight more flexible
alternative to React Router.

* It has simple code with minimum dependencies (just `path-to-regexp` and
  `babel-runtime`)
* It can be used with any JavaScript framework such as React, Vue.js etc
* It uses the same middleware approach used in Express and Koa, making it easy
  to learn
* It uses the exact same API and implementation to be used in both Node.js and
  browser environments

The
[Getting Started page](https://github.com/kriasoft/universal-router/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
has a few examples how to use it.
