## How to Integrate [Redux](http://redux.js.org/index.html)

Merge `feature/redux` branch with Git. If you are interested in
`feature/react-intl`, merge that branch instead as it also includes Redux.

**If you don't know Redux well, you should
[read about it first](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/index.html).**

### Creating Actions

1. Go to `src/constants/index.js` and define action name there.

2. Go to `src/actions/` and create file with appropriate name. You can copy
   `src/actions/runtime.js` as a template.

3. If you need async actions, use
   [`redux-thunk`](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk#readme). For
   inspiration on how to create async actions you can look at
   [`setLocale`](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/blob/feature/react-intl/src/actions/intl.js)
   action from `feature/react-intl`. See
   [Async Flow](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/AsyncFlow.html) for more
   information on this topic.

### Creating Reducer (aka Store)

1. Go to
   [`src/reducers/`](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/redux/src/reducers)
   and create new file there.

   You can copy
   [`src/reducers/runtime.js`](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/redux/src/reducers/runtime.js)
   as a template.

   * Do not forget to always return `state`.
   * Never mutate provided `state`. If you mutate state, rendering of connected
     component will not be triggered because of `===` equality. Always return
     new value if you perform state update. You can use this construct: `{
     ...state, updatedKey: action.payload.value, }`
   * Keep in mind that store state _must_ be repeatable by replaying actions on
     it. For example, when you store timestamp, pass it into _action payload_.
     If you call REST API, do it in action. _Never do this in reducer!_

2. Edit
   [`src/reducers/index.js`](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/redux/src/reducers/index.js),
   import your reducer and add it to root reducer created by
   [`combineReducers`](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/combineReducers.html)

### Connecting Components

You can use
[`connect()`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options)
High-Order Component from
[`react-redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux#readme) package.

See [Usage With React](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html) on
redux.js.org.

For an example you can look at
[`<LanguageSwitcher>`](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/blob/feature/react-intl/src/components/LanguageSwitcher/LanguageSwitcher.js)
component from `feature/react-intl` branch. It demonstrates both subscribing to
store and dispatching actions.

### Dispatching Actions On Server
