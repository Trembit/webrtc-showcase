## Contributing to React Starter Kit

React Starter Kit is currently the most widely adopted Node.js/React boilerplate
used by many tech startups around the globe. We're working hard to keep it up to
date, making sure that it follows best practices and high coding standards,
paying extremely close attention to details.

Your contributions are welcome and are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

### Conduct

Please, follow the [golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule). Be
respectful, even to those that are disrespectful.

### Feedback

Feedback is the breakfast for champions! We'd love to hear your opinions,
discuss potential improvements, architecture, theory, internal implementation,
etc. Please, join or start a new conversation in our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/issues),
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) chat room, or let's talk
face-to-face on [Appear.in](https://appear.in/react) or
[Skype](http://hatscripts.com/addskype?koistya).

### Documentation

We need your help with improving documentation to the project. This might be the
easiest way for you to contribute, because you don't even need to clone the repo
but can edit or create new `.md` files right from GitHub website as described
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).

### Bugs & Feature Requests

Before opening an issue, please:

* Check the
  [Getting Started](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
  guide.
* Search the
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/issues) to make
  sure your issue hasnâ€™t already been reported.
* If your issue sounds more like a question, please post it on StackOverflow.com
  instead with the tag
  [react-starter-kit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-starter-kit).

### Pull Requests

Before you submit a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from your
forked repo, check that it meets these guidelines:

* If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated as part of
  the same PR.
* Create a separate PR for each small feature or bug fix.
* [Squash](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git)
  your commits into one for each PR.
* Run `yarn test` to make sure that your code style is OK and there are no any
  regression bugs.
* When contributing to an opt-in feature, apply the `[feature/...]` tag as a
  prefix to your PR title

#### Style Guide

Our linter will catch most styling issues that may exist in your code. You can
check the status of your code styling by simply running: `yarn lint`

However, there are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up. If you are
unsure about something, looking at
[Airbnb's Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you in
the right direction.
